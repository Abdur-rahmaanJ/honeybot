## üìÆ About
HoneyBot is a python-based IRC bot.

Feel free to contribute to the project!

## üïπ Project Motivation
Implementing the project in Java was a nightmare, py's connect was sleek. Thus, the project stack was shifted over to Python.
If you can think of any features, plugins, or functionality you wish to see in the project. Feel free to add it yourself, or create an issue detailing your ideas. We highly recommend you attempt to implement it yourself first and ask for help in our slack page!

Psst. since i learnt py through this bot, we decided to keep a new-comers friendly policy. Feeling lost? Just ping.

## üîß Plugins Development

including it here. let's begin

a plugin has the following structure:

```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
"""
[greet.py]
Greet Plugin
[Author]
Abdur-Rahmaan Janhangeer, pythonmembers.club
[About]
responds to .hi, demo of a basic plugin
[Commands]
>>> .hi
returns hoo
"""


class Plugin:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def run(self, incoming, methods, info):
        try:
            if info['command'] == 'PRIVMSG' and info['args'][1] == '.hi':
                methods['send'](info['address'], 'hooo')
        except Exception as e:
            print('woops plugin error ', e)
```
we see three parameters being passed to the run method ```, incoming, methods, info)```

#### parameter1: incoming

```incoming``` is the raw line and is not used except if you are not satisfied with the already provided methods

#### parameter2: methods

```methods``` is a dictionary of methods to ease your life. a quick look at [main.py](honeybot/main.py) reveals

```python
def methods(self):
        return {
                'send_raw': self.send,
                'send': self.send_target,
                'join': self.join
                }
```
where ```send_raw``` allows you to send in any string you want, thereby allowing you to implement any irc protocol from scratch

but, for most uses, ```send``` allows you to send a message to an address ```methods['send']('<address>', '<message>')```. using it in conjunction with info parameter allows you to send messages where it came from, in pm to the bot or in a channel. you can however hardcode the address.

```join``` allows you to join a channel by ```methods['join']('<channel name>')```

#### parameter3: info

for a normal run, info produces
```python
{
'prefix': 'appinv!c5e342c5@gateway/web/cgi-irc/kiwiirc.com/ip.200.200.22.200',
'command': 'PRIVMSG',
'address': '##bottestingmu',
'args': ['##bottestingmu', 'ef']
}
```
hence if you want messages, ```messages = info['args'][1:]``` or the first word if you want to check for command will be ```info['args'][1]```

#### wrapping up

hence
```python
if info['command'] == 'PRIVMSG' and info['args'][1] == '.hi':
    methods['send'](info['address'], 'hooo')
```
from above means 
```
if message received == .hi:
    send(address, message)
```
